# 4-Bit CPU with Assembler
Overview

This project implements a 4-bit CPU in Verilog, complete with a testbench and an integrated assembler. The assembler simplifies the process of creating testbenches by allowing you to write instructions in a file and automatically generating a testbench for simulation.
Features

    4-Bit CPU: Fully functional CPU designed in Verilog.
    Assembler: Converts high-level assembly-like instructions into testbench-compatible format.
    Automated Testbench Generation: No need to manually write testbenches; simply define instructions in a file.
    Simulation: Use GTKWave to simulate the CPU and visualize outputs.

Usage
1. Write Instructions

Create a file (e.g., instructions.txt) with the instructions and opcodes for the CPU.
2. Generate Testbench

Run the assembler script to generate a testbench:

python assembler.py instructions.txt

This will output a testbench (e.g., cpu_testbench.v).
3. Simulate

Run the generated testbench in a Verilog simulator like GTKWave to observe the CPU's behavior:

# Example with a simulator
vvp cpu_testbench

Then, load the output in GTKWave to analyze signals.
Requirements

    Verilog Tools: Any Verilog simulator (e.g., ModelSim, Icarus Verilog).
    GTKWave: For waveform visualization.
    Python: To run the assembler.
